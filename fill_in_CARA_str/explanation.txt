This is a bit niche, but I often use CARA and couldn't figure out how to use the C(i-1) and CA(i-1) shifts for residues without associated systems.
This fills in the file generated by the CARA script WriteAssignments with any extra shifts from (i-1) positions missed by the software.
Yes I know it's possible to do this all in LUA within CARA, but I don't know very much about LUA.
