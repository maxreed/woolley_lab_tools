This is a bit niche, but I often use CARA and couldn't figure out how to use the C(i-1) and CA(i-1) shifts for residues without associated systems.
This fills in the file generated by the CARA script WriteAssignments with any extra shifts from (i-1) positions missed by the software.
Yes I know it's possible to do this all in LUA within CARA, but I don't know very much about LUA.
To do this, first import the WriteAllSystemsAllSpins_PMMR.lua script into CARA and execute it. Copy the output into a text file.
Next, run the WriteAssignments script the comes bundled with CARA's liquid protein NMR template. Copy that output into a str file.
Following that, run the python program gaf6_generate_modifiedStr.py (create an empty output file first).
None of this is super optimized, but it should just work.
